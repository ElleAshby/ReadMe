**Developing at a rapid pace, the creative computing community is becoming aware of the importance of pooling resources and collaboration with the emergence of open sourcing. However, this concept is not new, we can see this pattern of behaviour in other communities. Collaboration is key to evolving a network.

<br /> 
Exposing the working systems behind the sleek and polished surface design can also be found in the physical world. The culinary industry is an example of this, a meal can be compared to an app and the recipe behind it, the coding. There is a level of transparency about the process. This willingness to share and invite change is a quality we should foster and nurture.**

## Could this concept of Open Sourcing be expanded to something intrinsically different?

## Movement and Dance
-----------

These two communities although fundamentally different, share similar themes and challenges. Access for both computing and dance can be seen as exclusive and remote. Choreography acts as a key to decode movements and sequences. It takes the form of graphic notation - with movement being translated into a visual syntax. Behind every routine, the sequence of actions can be broken down into subsequent parts. The abstraction of language into drawings is reflective of coding. Dance is taught through learning the language of notation or attending expensive lessons. This is also seen through computing, there's plenty of exposure to websites and apps, however a specialist knowledge is needed to understand the processes behind the design.

These two worlds also collide, mixing digital and physical processes. The works of Merce Cunningham explores the relationship between algorithms and sequential arrangements of movement. 'Suite By Chance' explores the use of detailed charts which took months to complete and organise. They categorise movements which are then processed through a series of systems to determine the connection of actions in a sequence. By removing the human interaction with choreography, the routines were adapted and dehumanised, forcing the dancers to move in a systematic and unnatural way. The interaction between these two opposing communities is also explored through 'Double Agent', an instillation that blurs the boundaries between digital-physical interaction.

> # The algorithm finds patterns. By feeding it information from dancers, it develops its own concept of dance. Over many weeks, with the help of a supercomputer, the algorithm mapped dancerâ€™s movements and developed its own concept of what dancing is.

Open source allows editing, changing and adjusting code which intern lets others to learn through experience and others findings.  Adding, removing and rearranging elements of found routines in dance forms new and interesting sequences. This collaboration fosters a stronger relationship between the creator and the user. These two vastly different communities share essential values and the role of 'Open Sourcing'. Collaboration is key for inclusivity in communities.
