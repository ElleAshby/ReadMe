# Open Sourcing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br />
<br />


**Developing at a rapid pace, the creative computing community is becoming aware on the importance of pooling resources and collaboration with the emergence of open sourcing. However, this concept is not a new one, we can see this pattern of behaviour in other communities. Collaboration is key to evolving a network.
<br /> Exposing the working systems behind the sleek and polished surface design can also be found in the physical world. The culinary industry is an example of this, producing a meal (like an app) but sharing the recipe (like coding) and being transparent about your process. This willingness to share and invite change is something we should foster and nurture.**

## Could this concept of Open Sourcing be expanded to something intrinsically different?

## Movement and Dance
-----------

These two communities although fundamentally different, share similar themes and challenges. Access for both computing and dance can be seen as exclusive and remote. Choreography acts as a key to decode movements and sequences. It takes the form of graphic notation with movement being translated into a visual syntax. Behind every routine, the sequence of actions can be broken down into subsequent parts. This abstraction of language and insider knowledge can be found through the use of coding.

These two worlds also collide, mixing digital and physical processes. The works of Merce Cunningham explores the relationship between algorithms and sequential arrangements of movement. 'Suite By Chance' used detailed charts which took months to complete and organise. They document actions and movements which are then processed through a series of systems to determine the order of events and connections with other movements. By removing the human interaction with choreography, the movements were changed and dehumanised, forcing the dancers to move in a more systematic and unnatural routine. The interaction between these two opposing communities is also explored through 'Double Agent'

> # The algorithm finds patterns. By feeding it information from dancers, it develops its own concept of dance. Over many weeks, with the help of a supercomputer, the algorithm mapped dancerâ€™s movements and developed its own concept of what is dancing.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, these two communities struggle with exclusivity. Dance is taught through learning the language of notation or attending expensive lessons. This is also seen through computing, there's plenty of exposure to see the website and apps, however you have to share the codingand have specialist knowledge to understand th process.

These two vastly different communities are connected throug 
Open sourcing can allow people to collaborate, edit, change and adjust the code allowing their own personal mark and this can also be seen through dance. Dancers take elements of routines and combine them together to form new and interesting sequences. This collaboration fosters a stronger relationship between the creator and the user.
