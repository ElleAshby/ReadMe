Open Sourcing

**An Introduction**
The creative computing community is developing an awareness on the importance of pooling resources through open sourcing. With the constantly emerging field, it is clear through other communities that this collaboration is key to changing and evolving.

Stripping back and exposing the working systems behind the sleek and polished surface design can be found in the physical world. It can be compared to the culinary industry, producing a meal (app) but sharing the recipe (coding) and being transparent about your process.

Could this be expanded to something intrinsically different?

**Movement and dance.**

These two communities share similar themes and challenges. Like the use of open source, dance can be seen as exclusive and inaccessable. Choreography acts as a key to decode movements and sequences.
